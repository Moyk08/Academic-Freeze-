  <h3><em>Is there any Alternatives that both the Goverment, Teachers, and Students may Agree on?</em></h3>
  <p>The answer is Yes, There is an alternative that would change the whole scenario without sacrificing any of the list above
  and it required a <em>"Budget Cut" on the sectors of DepEd and CHED</em> </p>
  <h2>Why there should be a budget Cut on DepEd and CHED?</h2>
   <ol>
       <li>Teachers should receive payment by the government/Schools even if they are not teaching</li>
       <p>Atleast a support pay for the teachers to be able to survive the pandemic and without losing their jobs
       But? What is the purpose of the Teachers if they cannot teach?. It is up to the government and School to discuss what their
     job would be, it can be a support hotline for patients who are experiencing some kind of symptomps for Covid-19. Well i know that those are
   the jobs of healthcare professionals but since there are some low rate of nurses and doctors employment due to increasing amount of patients over the past
 months atleast it will give them a space for jobs and rest.</p>
      <li>The government should give up the budget to the sectors who are researching a vaccine for Covid-19</li>
      <p>Yes, the accumulated budget should be given to those reaseacher centers who are on the process of developing a cure for the pandemic
      Research centers like University of the Philippines and Polytechnic University of the Philippines who proved themselves over the past months
     remarkable help this pandemic. Researches like Alternative testing kits and Alcohol.</p>
     <li>Students should have access to learning activities, sites, and modules even without a tuition or paying for it</li>
     <p>The students should have access to this informations without paying a single cent. Why? simply because not all students are capable of buying subscriptions to sites
     that have a great services this can be <em>optional</em>. The learning services sites but as far as we are concerned students from elementary to college should be given
     modules they can read-on in their extra time without pressuring themselves to study with an experimental learning strata that the government and
     Schools wanted.</p>
